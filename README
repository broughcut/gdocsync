Sync with Google Docs
=====================

To use google docs as an off-site text cms.

Initial commit is boilerplate and only includes document list:

Gdocsync::Document.find(:all)

Will ultimately convert Google Documents to textile so they can be 
added to the local database via the user's Google feed and easily 
integrated.
